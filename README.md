# Fake-image-detections
This project aims to detect whether an image is real or fake using GAN model. With the rise of AI-generated content it's critical to verify image authenticity.
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is trained on datasets containing both real images and fake images . The model learns visual inconsistencies and predicts if an input image is genuine or manipulated.
Tech Stack used are:
* Python, TensorFlow/Keras
* OpenCV, NumPy
* Datasets: FFHQ, StyleGAN fakes
Output:
* Input: Any image
* Output: Real✅ or Fake ❌
